### Modern App Architecture (MVVM + Clean Architecture)
This Modern App Architecture encourages using the following techniques, among others:

> A reactive and layered architecture.
> Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) in all layers of the app.
> A UI layer with state holders to manage the complexity of the UI.
> Coroutines and flows.
> Dependency injection best practices.

Above is the Clean Architecture flow that shows how the data is requested until data is presented. 
Clean Architecture divided into 3 layers: (Presentation - Domain - Data)
